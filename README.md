# DigitalClock Component

*Deployed on Netlify ðŸ˜‰*\
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/2e395283-300f-421c-8df7-c989163c8f6d/deploy-status)](https://digital-clock-app-ahmmmyoo.netlify.app/)

This `DigitalClock` React component is a simple digital clock that displays the current time, updates every second, and shows the time in 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. It also sets the document title to "My Digital Clock" when the component is mounted.

### React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Features

- Displays the current time in `HH:MM:SS AM/PM` format.
- Updates every second to show the accurate time.
- Changes the document title to "My Digital Clock" when the component is mounted.

```

## Code Explanation

### Main Components and Logic

- **useState Hook**:

  - `const [time, setTime] = useState(new Date());`\
  - Manages the current time state, initialized to the current date and time.

- **useEffect Hook**:

  - The first `useEffect` sets the document title to "My Digital Clock" when the component mounts.
  - The second `useEffect` creates a timer using `setInterval` to update the time every second. It also returns a cleanup function to clear the interval when the component unmounts.

- **formatTime Function**:

  - Formats the current time into a    format.
  - Converts 24-hour time to 12-hour time and adds leading zeros where necessary.

- **padZero Function**:

  - Ensures that hours, minutes, and seconds are always displayed as two digits (e.g., `09` instead of `9`).
